# Linear Signals and Systems
## Analysis of discrete and continuous time signal systems through impulse responses, convolutions, Fourier transforms 

### Discrete-Time Linear Systems:
Covers discrete time signal analysis through impulse response, convolution, Z-transforms, and discrete-time Fourier analysis. Laboratories examines discrete-time signal analytical concepts through computer software in Python.

### Continuous-Time Linear Systems:
Introduction to continuous time signal analysis with basic signals including impulses, pulses, unit steps, and periodic signals. Analysis of signals through convolution of signals, fourier series and transforms in continuous time. Labs explores continuous-time signal analysis concepts through computer software in Python.
